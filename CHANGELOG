## 0.0.9

added `protected_mode` for 32-bit instruction decoding. BCD instructions not yet supported.

## 0.0.8

same as 0.0.7, but with a readme in the crates.io page.

## 0.0.7

`sse` and `sse2` support are mostly complete.
`jmp reg` erroneously decoded to 32-bit registers without `rex.w`.
`callf` could erroneously decode as having a register operand.
more comprehensive, if yet insufficiently tested, avx decoding.
support `vmclear` and `vmxon`, vmx still incomplete.

## 0.0.6

addressing modes using a sib byte with displacement != 0 were wrongly reported as having no displacement.

## 0.0.5

history basically starts here.

* impl Ord and PartialOrd on RegSpec and RegisterBank
* `RegSpec::name` to get `&'static str` labels for registers
* support `in` and `out` instructions

## 0.0.4 - 0.0.2

seriously stop, just don't use these versions

just bumps to use newer `yaxpeax-arch` since this is all wildly unstable
